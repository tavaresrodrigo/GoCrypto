# GoCrypto

A very simple local dashboard to show cryptoCurrency data as ranking and quotation via CLI.

## Setting up your api key 

We are working on a local version, in order to be able to fetch data from the coinmarketcap api you need to Sign up for a [free Developer Portal account](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/). Once you have your key, export it to your terminal with the name **CMMKVALUE**.

````
$export CMMKVALUE="key value"
````

You can also configure this variable in your profile, ex: ~/.zshenv,  ~/.bash-profile.
